We should stay and order in
Watch this all fall down
Cover up what little's left
Before the truth gets out

It used to be upon the fridge
Favorite items crossed out
Till I compile the final list
Of things I'd like to try

New day, riding through
Memorize, idealize
?
In time
Perhaps

But I don't call
I don't call anymore
Wasted harmonies
Won't beg for more

Different days mean different tastes
I'll replace your menu
She drove on by, by Plummer park
Right by her favorite venue

New day, riding through
Memorize, idealize
?
In time
Perhaps

But I don't call
I don't call anymore
Wasted harmonies
Won't beg for more

Trace me back
Through this moving picture
Trace me back
Through this moving picture
