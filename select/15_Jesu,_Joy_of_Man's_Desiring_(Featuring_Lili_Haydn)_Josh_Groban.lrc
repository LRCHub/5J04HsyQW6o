[01:04.02] Jesu, joy of man's desiring
[01:20.11] Holy wisdom, love most bright
[01:34.61] 
[02:02.83] Drawn by Thee, our souls aspiring
[02:18.10] Soar to uncreated light
[02:29.60] 
[02:54.27] Word of God, our flesh that fashioned
[03:12.77] 
[03:13.46] With the fire of life impassioned
[03:32.84] Striving still to truth unknown
[03:48.72] Soaring, dying round Thy throne
